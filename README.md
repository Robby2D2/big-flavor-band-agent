- **Audio Analysis**: Automatically extract BPM, key, genre hints, and energy from MP3 files with local caching
- **Smart Song Recommendations**: Get suggestions for what song to play next based on tempo, key, mood, and energy
- **Album Curation**: Automatically create album suggestions from your song library with optimal track ordering
- **Setlist Generation**: Create performance setlists with customizable energy flow patterns
- **Audio Engineering Assistance**: Get professional audio engineering suggestions to improve recording quality
- **Flow Analysis**: Analyze how well songs transition together in albums or setlists
- **MCP Server Integration**: Built with Model Context Protocol for AI agent connectivity
- **Intelligent Metadata**: Automatically infers genre, mood, and tags from song titles and sessions
- **Performance Optimized**: Cached audio analysis avoids re-analyzing unchanged files

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository

2. **Set up virtual environment** (recommended):
```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# or use the helper script: .\activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all dependencies including librosa for audio analysis.

4. Configure the agent (optional):
Edit `config.json` to customize settings like the website URL and cache settings.

> **Note**: A virtual environment is already set up for this project with all dependencies installed. See [VIRTUAL_ENV.md](VIRTUAL_ENV.md) for details.

### Running the Agent

#### Demo Mode (Recommended for Learning)

Run the agent in demo mode to see all features:

```powershell
python agent.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Song recommendations
- Album creation
- Audio engineering analysis
- Setlist generation

#### MCP Server Mode

To run the MCP server for integration with other AI systems:

```powershell
python mcp_server.py
```

The server exposes tools for:
- `get_song_library` - Fetch complete song library
- `search_songs` - Search by title, genre, or mood
- `get_song_details` - Get detailed song information
- `filter_songs_by_genre` - Filter by genre(s)
- `filter_songs_by_tempo` - Filter by tempo range
- `analyze_song_metadata` - Analyze song characteristics
- `analyze_local_audio` - Analyze MP3 files to extract BPM, key, and genre
- `get_audio_cache_stats` - View audio analysis cache statistics

#### Audio Analysis Mode

Pre-analyze audio files to populate the cache with BPM, key, and genre data:

```powershell
# Analyze all songs from RSS feed (this may take a while)
python pre_analyze_audio.py

# Analyze only first 5 songs (for testing)
python pre_analyze_audio.py --max-files 5

# Analyze local audio files
python pre_analyze_audio.py --local-dir "path/to/audio/files"
```

See [AUDIO_ANALYSIS.md](AUDIO_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed documentation.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Get Next Song Suggestion

```python
from agent import BigFlavorAgent

agent = BigFlavorAgent()
await agent.initialize()

# Suggest next song after current song
suggestion = await agent.suggest_next_song(
    current_song_id="song_001",
    mood="upbeat",
    energy="high"
)
print(suggestion)
```

### Create an Album

```python
# Create a themed album
album = await agent.create_album_suggestion(
    theme="upbeat rock",
    target_duration_minutes=45
)
print(f"Album: {album['album_name']}")
print(f"Tracks: {len(album['tracks'])}")
```

### Get Audio Engineering Suggestions

```python
# Get suggestions for improving a song
suggestions = await agent.get_audio_engineering_suggestions("song_002")
print(suggestions['improvement_suggestions'])
```

### Generate a Setlist

```python
# Create a setlist for a gig
setlist = await agent.suggest_setlist(
    duration_minutes=60,
    energy_flow="building"  # Options: varied, building, consistent
)
print(f"Setlist: {setlist['setlist_name']}")
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize:

- `website_url`: Your band's website URL
- `cache_duration`: How long to cache song library data (in seconds)
- `default_album_duration`: Default target album duration (minutes)
- `default_setlist_duration`: Default setlist duration (minutes)

## 📊 Song Data Format

Songs in the library should include:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_song_id",
  "title": "Song Title",
  "genre": "Rock",
  "tempo_bpm": 128,
  "key": "C Major",
  "duration_seconds": 245,
  "energy": "high",
  "mood": "upbeat",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "recording_date": "2024-06-15",
  "audio_quality": "good"
}
```

## 🌐 RSS Feed Integration - LIVE DATA! 🎉

**The MCP Server now uses REAL songs from bigflavorband.com!**

### ✅ What's Included

- **1,452 real songs** fetched from https://bigflavorband.com/rss
- **Automatic metadata parsing** including:
  - Song titles and variants
  - Recording sessions (e.g., "Kevin's Bar+Cart Birthday Bash", "Broken Pitchfork Retreat")
  - Direct MP3 download links
  - Publication dates
  - Inferred genres and moods
  - Auto-generated tags for instruments and styles

### Testing the RSS Integration

Run the test script to see real songs in action:

```powershell
python test_rss_parser.py
```

This will display:
- Total songs fetched from the RSS feed
- Sample songs with full metadata
- Search functionality demo
- Genre filtering demo

### How It Works

The MCP server:
1. Fetches the RSS feed from bigflavorband.com
2. Parses XML to extract song information
3. Infers genres based on keywords (Rock, Blues, Jazz, Acoustic/Folk)
4. Determines moods from song titles (melancholic, upbeat, energetic, romantic, reflective)
5. Generates tags from instruments mentioned (guitar, piano, drums, vocals, etc.)
6. Caches results for performance

### Example Real Songs

- "So Tired" - 45+ variations across different sessions
- "Here Comes a Regular" - Multiple live and studio versions
- "Hallelujah" - Various performer arrangements
- "This Year" - Different interpretations and sessions
- "Rock and Roll" - Live recordings and studio takes

## 🤝 Contributing to Your Library

To add new songs to your library:

1. Add song metadata to the website/database
2. Include all required fields (id, title, genre, tempo, etc.)
3. The agent will automatically include them in recommendations

## 🎓 Learning Resources

This project demonstrates:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Building AI agent servers
- **Async Python**: Using asyncio for concurrent operations
- **Music Theory**: Key compatibility, tempo, and flow

- **Recommendation Systems**: Scoring and ranking algorithms

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### MCP Server Not Connecting
Ensure the server is running and check the logs for errors.

### No Songs Found
If using the demo, mock data should load automatically. Check that `_get_mock_songs()` is working.
